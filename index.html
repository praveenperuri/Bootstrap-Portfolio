			<p>
			I can vividly remember the first time I saw a desktop computer at the age of 7 at my neighbor’s. I first saw it is a platform for gaming but eventually I would get my own computer with Windows 95 OS and I started realizing the potential of these machines and how they can change the world. A life decision was made as I eventually wound up working as a Computer Science professional. Although my initial experience with computers started as a leisure activity, my interest was really piqued when I started learning programming languages like C, C++, C#, HTML etc. 			
			</p>

			<p>
				It was just a start as I completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Not sitting back, I went ahead and attained a Master’s degree in Computer Science with majors in Software Engineering. The graduate program played a vital part in shaping my career as a Software Engineer.As a computer science professional I have worked in finance, manufacturing, e-commerce, construction and health care industries. In my profession, I have applied my knowledge of computer science and technology to maximize the potential of a business entity or an industry using Microsoft .NET technologies. Currently, I work in the Healthcare sector for a large firm that provides wide range of services and operational resources for health plan providers.
